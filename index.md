# Tech Notes

Welcome! 

These are a collection of notes from using and learning about tools/systems. They are principally to be a reminder to me and also to provide motivation to take good notes. I also believe that is important to [learn in the open](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z21cgR9K3UcQ5a7yPsj2RUim3oM2TzdBByZu).

Needless to say these notes are all a Work In Progress and are subject to constant change/revision/deletion..

If you think anything could be better or you just want to say hello head over the source repo and make an issue or a PR.
